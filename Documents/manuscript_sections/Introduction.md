# Introduction

The increasing frequency of space launches has led to growing concerns about 
rocket stage re-entry and its environmental impacts. When rocket stages 
descends back to Earth, they poses significant risks to ecosystems, 
infrastructure, and human safety. The Republic of Kazakhstan, with its vast 
territory used as drop zones for Russian and international space programs, 
faces particular challenges in managing these risks.

Historically, rocket stage drop zones was selected based primarily on 
population density and infrastructure considerations, with limited attention 
to ecological sensitivity. This approach has resulted in environmental 
damage, including vegetation loss, soil contamination, and fire outbreaks. 
As space activities intensifies globally, there is an urgent need for 
systematic, data-driven approaches to identify Optimal Touchdown Units 
(OTUs) – areas where rocket stage re-entries would cause minimal 
environmental harm.

Previous studies has addressed various aspects of rocket re-entry analysis, 
including trajectory prediction, risk assessment, and debris dispersion 
modeling. However, few has integrated multi-source remote sensing data 
with ecological indices to assess terrain stability comprehensively. 
This study fills this gap by developing a OTU framework that combines 
satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and soil data within a 
geographic information system (GIS) environment.

The primary objectives of this research is: (1) to develop a 
multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for OTU identification; 
(2) to apply this framework to Kazakhstan's rocket drop zones; (3) to 
validate the results using historical impact data; and (4) to estimate 
the economic benefits of OTU-based site selection.

The methodology builds upon established ecological assessment techniques 
but adapts them specifically for rocket impact scenarios. Key innovations 
includes the integration of fire hazard assessment with traditional 
stability indices and the development of a weighted scoring system that 
reflects the unique requirements of rocket stage re-entries.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the study area 
and data sources. Section 3 details the methodology, including index 
calculation and OTU computation. Section 4 presents the results, 
including OTU maps and validation statistics. Section 5 discusses the 
implications for space policy and environmental management. Section 6 
concludes with recommendations for future research and implementation.
