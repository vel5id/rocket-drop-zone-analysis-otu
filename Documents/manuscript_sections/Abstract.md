# Abstract

This paper presents an new methodology for Optimal Touchdown Unit (OTU) analysis 
for rocket stage drop zones in Kazakhstan. The method integrates satellite remote 
sensing data, topographic analysis, and ecological indices to assess terrain 
stability and environmental risk. A multi-criteria decision analysis framework 
was developed, incorporating vegetation cover, soil stability, relief complexity, 
and fire hazard. Results demonstrates that approximately 65% of the study area 
exhibits high or moderate stability suitable for controlled re-entries. The 
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for space agencies and regulatory 
bodies to minimize environmental impact and economic damage from rocket stage 
re-entries.

The study area covers approximately 150,000 km² in central Kazakhstan, 
encompassing regions historically used for rocket stage descents from the 
Baikonur Cosmodrome. Data from Sentinel-2, SRTM DEM, and SoilGrids was 
processed using Google Earth Engine and custom Python algorithms. Four primary 
indices was calculated: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 
Soil Stability Index (SI), Biodiversity Index (BI), and Relief Complexity 
Index (RCI). These indices was combined using weighted linear combination 
to produce the OTU score ranging from 0 (low stability) to 1 (high stability).

Validation was performed using historical impact data and field surveys. 
The OTU model shows strong correlation (r = 0.78) with observed stability 
assessments. Economic analysis reveals that implementing OTU-based site 
selection could reduce cleanup costs by up to 40% compared to current 
ad-hoc approaches. The framework is scalable and can be adapted to other 
regions with similar space infrastructure.
