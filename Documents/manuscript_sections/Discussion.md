## 4.1 Interpretation of Findings

The OTU framework developed in this study provides a systematic 
approach for identifying optimal rocket stage drop zones based on 
terrain stability and environmental sensitivity. The strong 
correlation (r = 0.78) between predicted and observed stability 
validates the methodology and suggests that remote sensing indices 
can effectively capture factors relevant to rocket impact outcomes.

The predominance of relief complexity as the most influential 
factor aligns with engineering principles of rocket stage descent. 
Steep slopes increases the likelihood of fragmentation upon impact 
and complicates recovery operations. The high weighting assigned 
to RCI in our model reflects this physical reality.

The economic analysis reveals substantial potential savings from 
OTU-based site selection. The 40% reduction in estimated cleanup 
costs represents a compelling argument for adopting this approach 
in operational planning. For space agencies operating under budget 
constraints, such savings could enables more frequent missions or 
enhanced safety measures.

## 4.2 Comparison with Previous Work

Previous studies on rocket drop zone selection has primarily 
focused on population density and infrastructure avoidance. 
While these factors remains important for safety, our study 
demonstrates that ecological considerations can be integrated 
without compromising safety objectives. The OTU framework 
complements existing risk assessment methodologies by adding 
an environmental dimension.

Compared to traditional field-based assessments, the remote 
sensing approach offers several advantages: (1) comprehensive 
coverage of large areas, (2) consistent application of criteria, 
(3) ability to update assessments with new imagery, and (4) 
cost-effectiveness. The main limitation is the reliance on 
proxy indicators rather than direct measurements of soil 
strength or vegetation resilience.

## 4.3 Practical Applications

The OTU framework has several practical applications for 
space agencies and regulatory bodies:

1. **Pre-mission planning**: OTU maps can informs trajectory 
   adjustments to target high-stability areas.
2. **Environmental impact assessment**: OTU scores provides 
   quantitative metrics for evaluating potential impacts of 
   proposed re-entries.
3. **Compensation calculation**: OTU-based cost estimates 
   can guides compensation negotiations between space 
   agencies and affected regions.
4. **Monitoring and restoration**: OTU assessments can 
   prioritizes areas for post-impact monitoring and 
   ecological restoration.

For Kazakhstan specifically, the OTU framework could supports 
the development of a national rocket drop zone management 
strategy. By identifying zones of varying suitability, 
policymakers can establishes tiered regulatory approaches 
with different requirements for high-risk versus low-risk areas.

## 4.4 Limitations and Future Research

Several limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. 
First, the validation relies on historical impact data that may 
not represent optimal targeting (i.e., impacts may have occurred 
in suboptimal areas precisely because systematic selection was 
not used). Second, the indices used are proxies for complex 
ecological processes; direct measurements of soil compaction 
resistance or vegetation recovery rates would strengthens the 
assessment.

Future research directions includes:
1. **Temporal dynamics**: Incorporating seasonal variations 
   in vegetation and soil moisture.
2. **Higher resolution data**: Using UAV or high-resolution 
   satellite imagery for detailed site assessments.
3. **Integration with trajectory models**: Coupling OTU 
   assessment with precise re-entry trajectory prediction.
4. **Expansion to other regions**: Applying the framework 
   to other rocket launch sites globally.
5. **Real-time monitoring**: Developing automated systems 
   for near-real-time OTU assessment during mission operations.

## 4.5 Policy Implications

The findings has important implications for space policy and 
environmental regulation. As space activities increases 
globally, there is growing need for standardized environmental 
assessment protocols for rocket operations. The OTU framework 
could serves as a foundation for such protocols, providing 
transparent, repeatable methodology for evaluating drop zone 
suitability.

International agreements such as the Outer Space Treaty could 
be supplemented with guidelines for environmental protection 
during re-entry operations. The development of OTU-like 
assessment tools for different ecological contexts would 
facilitates global implementation of best practices.

For Kazakhstan, the study provides evidence-based foundation 
for revising compensation mechanisms and regulatory requirements. 
By linking environmental sensitivity to economic costs, the 
framework creates incentives for space agencies to minimize 
ecological impacts through careful site selection.
